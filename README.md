# WebChat - Chat with Website

Welcome to the WebChat - Chat with Website GitHub repository! This project serves as a dynamic platform for building a chatbot capable of interacting with websites, extracting information, and engaging in context-aware conversations through a Streamlit graphical interface. By harnessing the capabilities of LangChain 0.1.0, developers can create powerful conversational AI applications.

## Demo

You can access the deployed demo of the chatbot on Streamlit by visiting [WebChat Demo](https://webchat-demo.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- **Website Interaction:** The application scrapes website content based on user input, allowing them to specify the scraping depth.
    - Depth 1: Scrapes only the content of the given page.
    - Depth 2: Scrapes the content of the given page along with the links present on that page, etc.

    This depth parameter enables users to control the extent of the scraping process, facilitating comprehensive data extraction from websites.

- **Contextual Conversation:** The chatbot maintains a context-aware conversation history, allowing it to provide relevant responses based on previous interactions.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The chatbot employs RAG techniques to enhance response generation by augmenting its knowledge with retrieved information from websites.

- **Streamlit GUI:** Built using Streamlit, the chatbot offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users can easily interact with the chatbot and view conversation history.
